                This app allows you to generate several sounds that are helpful for focus, relaxation, sleep, blocking external sounds, and etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has several ambiances and can generate white, pink or brown noises.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several presets with most common sounds people seem to love, but there is an advanced section which allows you to configure the sounds to your requirement.

# Ambiance & Noise generator

App to generate noises and ambiance for work, sleep, focus and relaxation.

**First my motivation:**

- I hate that tracks and videos online for ambiance or noise are 3hr, 10 hr and plus tracks. 
- And then the ads. OMG. Kills the very idea of peace, focus or sleep.
- And, it is not that complicated that needs such a long videos to offer that.
- Hence, this tool. It is simple, does the job, can generate noise offline.

**About this project:**

- Works offline, it is installable as well. I will wrap this in a mobile app soon.
- I have created loopable tracks of various ambiances as well. (The original recordings are not mine, see the credits).
- Deliberately based on basic HTML, JS and CSS. Because I want a side project with just that.

**Development:**

- There is a simple script to launch a dev server. It is based on python (just because)

    Run it

    ```sh
    python3 server.py
    ```
